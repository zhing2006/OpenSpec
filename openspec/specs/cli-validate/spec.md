# cli-validate Specification

## Purpose
Define `openspec validate` behavior for validating changes and specs with actionable remediation guidance and structured output.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Validation SHALL provide actionable remediation steps
Validation output SHALL include specific guidance to fix each error, including expected structure, example headers, and suggested commands to verify fixes.

#### Scenario: No deltas found in change
- **WHEN** validating a change with zero parsed deltas
- **THEN** show error "No deltas found" with guidance:
  - Explain that change specs must include `## ADDED Requirements`, `## MODIFIED Requirements`, `## REMOVED Requirements`, or `## RENAMED Requirements`
  - Remind authors that files must live under `openspec/changes/{id}/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
  - Include an explicit note: "Spec delta files cannot start with titles before the operation headers"
  - Suggest running `openspec change show {id} --json --deltas-only` for debugging

#### Scenario: Missing required sections
- **WHEN** a required section is missing
- **THEN** include expected header names and a minimal skeleton:
  - For Spec: `## Purpose`, `## Requirements`
  - For Change: `## Why`, `## What Changes`
  - Provide an example snippet of the missing section with placeholder prose ready to copy
  - Mention the quick-reference section in `openspec/AGENTS.md` as the authoritative template

#### Scenario: Missing requirement descriptive text
- **WHEN** a requirement header lacks descriptive text before scenarios
- **THEN** emit an error explaining that `### Requirement:` lines must be followed by narrative text before any `#### Scenario:` headers
  - Show compliant example: "### Requirement: Foo" followed by "The system SHALL ..."
  - Suggest adding 1-2 sentences describing the normative behavior prior to listing scenarios
  - Reference the pre-validation checklist in `openspec/AGENTS.md`

### Requirement: Validator SHALL detect likely misformatted scenarios and warn with a fix
The validator SHALL recognize bulleted lines that look like scenarios (e.g., lines beginning with WHEN/THEN/AND) and emit a targeted warning with a conversion example to `#### Scenario:`.

#### Scenario: Bulleted WHEN/THEN under a Requirement
- **WHEN** bullets that start with WHEN/THEN/AND are found under a requirement without any `#### Scenario:` headers
- **THEN** emit warning: "Scenarios must use '#### Scenario:' headers", and show a conversion template:
```
#### Scenario: Short name
- **WHEN** ...
- **THEN** ...
- **AND** ...
```

### Requirement: All issues SHALL include file paths and structured locations
Error, warning, and info messages SHALL include:
- Source file path (`openspec/changes/{id}/proposal.md`, `.../specs/{cap}/spec.md`)
- Structured path (e.g., `deltas[0].requirements[0].scenarios`)

#### Scenario: Zod validation error
- **WHEN** a schema validation fails
- **THEN** the message SHALL include `file`, `path`, and a remediation hint if applicable

### Requirement: Invalid results SHALL include a Next steps footer in human-readable output
The CLI SHALL append a Next steps footer when the item is invalid and not using `--json`, including:
- Summary line with counts
- Top-3 guidance bullets (contextual to the most frequent or blocking errors)
- A suggestion to re-run with `--json` and/or the debug command

#### Scenario: Change invalid summary
- **WHEN** a change validation fails
- **THEN** print "Next steps" with 2-3 targeted bullets and suggest `openspec change show <id> --json --deltas-only`

### Requirement: Top-level validate command

The CLI SHALL provide a top-level `validate` command for validating changes and specs with flexible selection options. Spec matching SHALL support both leaf names and full nested paths.

#### Scenario: Interactive validation selection

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate` without arguments
- **THEN** prompt user to select what to validate (all, changes, specs, or specific item)
- **AND** display specs with full nested paths in the selection list
- **AND** perform validation based on selection
- **AND** display results with appropriate formatting

#### Scenario: Non-interactive environments do not prompt

- **GIVEN** stdin is not a TTY or `--no-interactive` is provided or environment variable `OPEN_SPEC_INTERACTIVE=0`
- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate` without arguments
- **THEN** do not prompt interactively
- **AND** print a helpful hint listing available commands/flags and exit with code 1

#### Scenario: Direct item validation by full path

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate Client/Combat/combat-system`
- **THEN** detect as a spec by matching against full nested paths
- **AND** validate the specified spec

#### Scenario: Direct item validation by leaf name

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate combat-system`
- **AND** only one spec has leaf directory name `combat-system`
- **THEN** resolve it to the full path and validate it

#### Scenario: Ambiguous leaf name

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate combat-damage`
- **AND** multiple specs exist with leaf name `combat-damage` at different paths
- **THEN** display an ambiguity error listing all matching full paths
- **AND** exit with code 1

### Requirement: Bulk and filtered validation

The validate command SHALL support flags for bulk validation (--all) and filtered validation by type (--changes, --specs). Spec discovery SHALL use recursive scanning.

#### Scenario: Validate everything

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --all`
- **THEN** validate all changes in openspec/changes/ (excluding archive)
- **AND** recursively validate all specs in openspec/specs/ (including nested directories)
- **AND** display a summary showing passed/failed items with full paths
- **AND** exit with code 1 if any validation fails

#### Scenario: Scope of bulk validation

- **WHEN** validating with `--all` or `--changes`
- **THEN** include all change proposals under `openspec/changes/`
- **AND** exclude the `openspec/changes/archive/` directory

- **WHEN** validating with `--specs`
- **THEN** recursively include all specs that have a `spec.md` under `openspec/specs/`
- **AND** scan nested directories at arbitrary depth

#### Scenario: Validate all changes

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --changes`
- **THEN** validate all changes in openspec/changes/ (excluding archive)
- **AND** display results for each change
- **AND** show summary statistics

#### Scenario: Validate all specs

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --specs`
- **THEN** recursively validate all specs in openspec/specs/
- **AND** display results for each spec with full nested path
- **AND** show summary statistics

### Requirement: Validation options and progress indication

The validate command SHALL support standard validation options (--strict, --json) and display progress during bulk operations.

#### Scenario: Strict validation

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --all --strict`
- **THEN** apply strict validation to all items
- **AND** treat warnings as errors
- **AND** fail if any item has warnings or errors

#### Scenario: JSON output

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --all --json`
- **THEN** output validation results as JSON
- **AND** include detailed issues for each item
- **AND** include summary statistics

#### Scenario: JSON output schema for bulk validation

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --all --json` (or `--changes` / `--specs`)
- **THEN** output a JSON object with the following shape:
  - `items`: Array of objects with fields `{ id: string, type: "change"|"spec", valid: boolean, issues: Issue[], durationMs: number }`
  - `summary`: Object `{ totals: { items: number, passed: number, failed: number }, byType: { change?: { items: number, passed: number, failed: number }, spec?: { items: number, passed: number, failed: number } } }`
  - `version`: String identifier for the schema (e.g., `"1.0"`)
- **AND** exit with code 1 if any `items[].valid === false`

Where `Issue` follows the existing per-item validation report shape `{ level: "ERROR"|"WARNING"|"INFO", path: string, message: string }`.

#### Scenario: Show validation progress

- **WHEN** validating multiple items (--all, --changes, or --specs)
- **THEN** show progress indicator or status updates
- **AND** indicate which item is currently being validated
- **AND** display running count of passed/failed items

#### Scenario: Concurrency limits for performance

- **WHEN** validating multiple items
- **THEN** run validations with a bounded concurrency (e.g., 4–8 in parallel)
- **AND** ensure progress indicators remain responsive

### Requirement: Item type detection and ambiguity handling

The validate command SHALL handle ambiguous names and explicit type overrides to ensure clear, deterministic behavior. Spec matching SHALL support both leaf names and full nested paths.

#### Scenario: Direct item validation with automatic type detection

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate <item-name>`
- **THEN** if `<item-name>` uniquely matches a change or a spec (by full path or unique leaf name), validate that item

#### Scenario: Ambiguity between change and spec names

- **GIVEN** `<item-name>` exists both as a change and as a spec
- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate <item-name>`
- **THEN** print an ambiguity error explaining both matches
- **AND** suggest passing `--type change` or `--type spec`, or using `openspec change validate` / `openspec spec validate`
- **AND** exit with code 1 without performing validation

#### Scenario: Unknown item name

- **WHEN** the `<item-name>` matches neither a change nor a spec (checked by full path and leaf name)
- **THEN** print a not-found error
- **AND** show nearest-match suggestions when available
- **AND** exit with code 1

#### Scenario: Explicit type override

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --type change <item>`
- **THEN** treat `<item>` as a change ID and validate it (skipping auto-detection)

- **WHEN** executing `openspec validate --type spec <item>`
- **THEN** treat `<item>` as a spec ID (full path or leaf name) and validate it (skipping auto-detection)

### Requirement: Interactivity controls

- The CLI SHALL respect `--no-interactive` to disable prompts.
- The CLI SHALL respect `OPEN_SPEC_INTERACTIVE=0` to disable prompts globally.
- Interactive prompts SHALL only be shown when stdin is a TTY and interactivity is not disabled.

#### Scenario: Disabling prompts via flags or environment

- **WHEN** `openspec validate` is executed with `--no-interactive` or with environment `OPEN_SPEC_INTERACTIVE=0`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL not display interactive prompts
- **AND** SHALL print non-interactive hints or chosen outputs as appropriate

### Requirement: Parser SHALL handle cross-platform line endings
The markdown parser SHALL correctly identify sections regardless of line ending format (LF, CRLF, CR).

#### Scenario: Required sections parsed with CRLF line endings
- **GIVEN** a change proposal markdown saved with CRLF line endings
- **AND** the document contains `## Why` and `## What Changes`
- **WHEN** running `openspec validate <change-id>`
- **THEN** validation SHALL recognize the sections and NOT raise parsing errors

### Requirement: Delta spec validation SHALL support nested directory structure

The validator SHALL recursively discover delta spec files within a change's `specs/` directory, supporting arbitrary nesting depth to mirror the target spec tree structure.

#### Scenario: Validate delta specs in nested directories

- **WHEN** validating a change that has delta specs at `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/Client/Combat/combat-system/spec.md`
- **THEN** discover and validate the delta spec
- **AND** report issues with the full relative path (e.g., `Client/Combat/combat-system/spec.md`)

#### Scenario: Validate delta specs in flat directories (backward compatibility)

- **WHEN** validating a change that has delta specs at `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/combat-system/spec.md`
- **THEN** discover and validate the delta spec as before
- **AND** maintain backward compatibility with flat structure

#### Scenario: Validate delta specs on Windows paths

- **WHEN** validating a change on Windows
- **THEN** use `path.join()` for all path construction
- **AND** normalize path separators when comparing or reporting paths
